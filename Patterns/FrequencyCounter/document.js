// Facts about FrequencyCounter pattern
// 1. This pattern uses objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of values
// 2. This can often avoid the need for nested loops or O(N^2) operations with arrays/strings
//* Example:
//* Write a function called same, which accepts two arrays.
//* The function should return true if every value in the array has it's corresponding value squared in the second array.
//* The frequency of values must be the same.
