// Facts about MultiplePointers pattern
// 1. Creating pointers or values that correspond to an index or position and move towards the beginning, end or middle based on a certain condition
// 2. Very efficient for solving problems with minimal space complexity as well
//* Example:
//* Write a function called sumZero which accepts a sorted array of integers.
//* The function should find the first pair where the sum is 0.
//* Return an array that includes both values that sum to zero or undefined if a pair does not exist.
