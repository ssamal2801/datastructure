// Facts about SlidingWindow pattern
// 1. This pattern involves creating a window which can either be an array or number from one position to another
// 2. Depending on a certain condition, the window either increases or closes (and a new window is created)
// 3. Very useful for keeping track of a subset of data in an array/string etc.
// Example:
//* Write a function called maxSubarraySum which accepts an array of integers and a number called n.
//* The function should calculate the maximum sum of n consecutive elements in the array.

// Write a function called maxSubarraySum which accepts an array of integers and a number called n.
// The function should calculate the maximum sum of n consecutive elements in the array.
// Example: maxSubarraySum([1,2,5,2,8,1,5],2) // 10
